# Jonas-Schmedtmann
This repository contains all the projects, challenges, and practice apps I created while taking Jonas Schmedtmann’s Ultimate React Course. It showcases React fundamentals, state management, hooks, routing, and real-world app structures—all coded by me as part of my learning journey.
